# THAT DAY 
IMAGINARY AUTHORS X PENGUIN RANDOM HOUSE

That day… we all have one.

Maybe it’s a memory from the past or a moment you’re dreaming about in the future. It’s a day that carries a special scent—something that instantly brings it to life.

With That Day, Imaginary Authors and Penguin Random House celebrate those moments through a unique pairing of our bestselling fragrances and books. Together, we’ve created an experience that bridges the worlds of storytelling and scent, blending the literal and the metaphorical.

Here’s how it works: Pick a “kind of day” that intrigues you. It’s like a blind box—your choice reveals a pairing of a fragrance and a book crafted to evoke that feeling. Want more? Share a short story inspired by your match, and you’ll receive a free eBook and a 2ml fragrance trial to bring the story to life. The top three stories will be published and awarded the full Discovery Collection—featuring all iconic scents.

Breathe the memories. That day in a press.
